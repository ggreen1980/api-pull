# Pulling in data from third party API


### This is a React application built with no styling and is only presented to show how a third party API can be used to pull in data. The data used is example data which is not real and can be found at 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users'. It is not meant to show real data or intended for any real use. 

&nbsp;

## Attribution

### The data found at the above http address is not mine and is not a creation of mine. It is available for use as an example in building out sites so that data can be fetched and worked with without having to use real data or an actual third party API that may have costs associated with it.

&nbsp;

## Next Step

### This project is simply meant to illustrate the pulling in of external data to a web application, but next steps may include:
    - adding some styling
    - creating search functionality to search the information contained in the API



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.# api-pull
